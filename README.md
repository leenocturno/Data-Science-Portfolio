## About Me

- My name, Li Feng, is pronounced as "lee-fung". In Chinese tradition, the last name comes before the given name. Therefore, "Li" is my last name, and "Feng" is my given name. In accordance with Chinese naming customs, I do not have a middle name, and "Li Feng" is my complete legal name.
- Earned my Bachelor's degree in English/Chinese translation. Worked as a Chinese/Spanish translator for my first job while living in several countries in Latin America.
- Currently living in Seattle and working in the Knowledge Management field for a large pharmaceutical company. I have 6 years of experience in documentation management and data management in the regulatory field.
- My skills and experience cover almost all aspects of documentation managemnet: composing, editing, controlling, quantitative analysis of document records, and project management.
- Current position primarily involves:
  - Management of documents:
    - ranging from small to large quantities.
    - both in a controlled and non-controlled environment.
  - Analysis and management of department KPIs.
  - Project management responsibilities.


## Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/leenocturno/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Images/project-1%20stroke%20analysis.jpeg"> **[Project 1 - Stroke Analysis & Prediction](https://github.com/leenocturno/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Project%201%20-%20Stroke%20Analysis%20%26%20Prediction/stroke_analysis_and_prediction.ipynb)**

This project first examines variables, their distributions and correlations. It then applies four machine learning models to predict strokes, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and finally XGBoost, followed by a comparative assessment of their performance. This project also investigates the top predictors among all the variables.

This project investigates and contrasts 3 marketing promotions deployed across 3 different market sizes spanning 548 locations. It evaluates whether these promotion strategies yield statistically significant differences. The dataset's normality is assessed, and the appropriate A/B testing methodology is applied for the analysis.

This project crawls Wikipedia pages for selected titles and converts the articles into PDFs. Using a GPT-based model, it creates a Knowledge Management chatbot that retrieves information from the PDFs and answer user questions based strictly on their content.
